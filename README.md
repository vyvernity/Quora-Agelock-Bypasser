## How to Install
- Install the release of the bypass
- After you download it unzip the file
- After unziping make sure it's a folder and not just manifest.json, icon.png and bypass.js that is extracted
- Once you've made sure the files are under a folder, go to **chrome://extensions** for chrome or **brave://extensions** for brave
- Make sure you turn on **Developer Mode** which is located on the top right.
- Once you are on developer mode, click on the load unpacked button and choose the folder which the files are in
- And you are done! the webbrowser will not automatically bypass all quora pages.
